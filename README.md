Project One: Create a service bot. My bot puts together a basketball team for the user.
I am a member of the WVU pep band, and I currently spend a lot of my time playing for men’s and women’s basketball games.  For my project,
I wanted to create a bot that would put together a basketball team of five starters.  The user inputs their choices for the five different
starting positions.  Then using constructors, different team possibilities are outputted based off how many players the user can pick and
how many players are assigned to the user. The user decides from zero to five how many players they want to be able to pick.  The program
then outputs a team with the specified number of players picked by the user with the rest chosen by the program.
